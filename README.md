## Foundations

### Primitive Variable Types

**What are "types" in C++**? The type determines the kind of data that can be stored in a variable, as well as the operations could be performed on that data.  

There are several built-in types in C++. These include integral types (which represent whole numbers), floating-point (which represent fractional numbers) and void (which represents an empty set of values).

### Vector

**What is a vector**? it's simply a linear sequence of contiguously allocated memory.

The hash tables and maps for collection of data that's kept sorted.
