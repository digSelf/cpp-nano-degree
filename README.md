## Foundations

### Primitive Variable Types

**What are "types" in C++**? The type determines the kind of data that can be stored in a variable, as well as the operations could be performed on that data.  

There are several built-in types in C++. These include integral types (which represent whole numbers), floating-point (which represent fractional numbers) and void (which represents an empty set of values).

### Vector

**What is a vector**? it's simply a linear sequence of contiguously allocated memory.

The hash tables and maps for collection of data that's kept sorted.

### Comments

The comments should be used to say things that you cannot do well in code.
Obviously, the code thells you **how** something is done. it doesn't tell you what a high level it's been done or why it's being done.  

The comments are used to tell you what the code is supposed to do. For things that you can't say wall in code, if there's a complicated piece of code, explain what's supposed to do.
