# CppND-System-Monitor

Starter code for System Monitor Project in the Object Oriented Programming Course of the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). 

Follow along with the classroom lesson to complete the project!

## Udacity Linux Workspace
[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) provides a browser-based Linux [Workspace](https://engineering.udacity.com/creating-a-gpu-enhanced-virtual-desktop-for-udacity-497bdd91a505) for students. 

You are welcome to develop this project on your local machine, and you are not required to use the Udacity Workspace. However, the Workspace provides a convenient and consistent Linux development environment we encourage you to try.

## ncurses
[ncurses](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/) is a library that facilitates text-based graphical output in the terminal. This project relies on ncurses for display output.

Within the Udacity Workspace, `.student_bashrc` automatically installs ncurses every time you launch the Workspace.

If you are not using the Workspace, install ncurses within your own Linux environment: `sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`

## Make
This project uses [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). The Makefile has four targets:
* `build` compiles the source code and generates an executable
* `format` applies [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to style the source code
* `debug` compiles the source code and generates an executable, including debugging symbols
* `clean` deletes the `build/` directory, including all of the build artifacts

## Instructions

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/udacity/CppND-System-Monitor-Project-Updated.git`

2. Build the project: `make build`

3. Run the resulting executable: `./build/monitor`

4. Follow along with the lesson.

5. Implement the `System`, `Process`, and `Processor` classes, as well as functions within the `LinuxParser` namespace.

6. Submit!

# Data

## System Data

Linux stores a lot of system data in files within the `/proc/` directory. 

Information about the **Operation System** exists outside of the `/proc/` directory, in the `/etc/os-release` file.

Information about the **Kernel** exists `/proc/version` file.

Information about the **Memory Utilization** exists in the `/proc/meminfo` file.

Information about the total number of **processes** on the system exists in the `/proc/meminfo`.

information about system up time exists in the `/proc/uptime`

## Processor

information about utilization exists `/proc/stat`

Linux stores processor utilization data within the `/proc/stat` file.

## Process

The UID for a process is sotred in `/etc/[PID]/status`

`/etc/passwd` contains the information necessary to match the UID to a username.

Linux stores the CPU utilization of a process in the `/proc/[UID]/stat` file
